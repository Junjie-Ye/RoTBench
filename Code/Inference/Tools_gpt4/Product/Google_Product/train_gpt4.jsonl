Yes it lacks the outputs of previous models and newer models as well, but I rarely use near the 512GBs of storage and they do sell several different models of adaptors that allow the use of three monitors for far less than what you can get the current model for. I purchased a 1TB hard drive for extra storage and I have two 4K monitors hooked up to mine with an adapter that I paid about $200 for. I got this on sale to begin with and that was really nice as the price paid for the adapter that adds support for three 4K monitors, but two is actually more than I thought I needed. I also purchased a mouse and keyboard for mine that are space gray and I’m currently in the process of buying a DAC as I can rip my Japanese MQA CDs from disc to files to playback on my Astell&Kern DAP. I can also stream MQA audio to other devices that support the audio format. That’s why I purchased this device to begin with. This is my third MacBook Pro and it is the smallest one I’ve owned, but I have never had a dual monitor set up with the previous two models and the M2 processor is really fast if you have access to gigabyte internet speeds. None of my previous models had as much memory and I was fortunate enough to get this when it was on sale. Apple has got to stop expecting people to buy new devices every 3 to 5 years. I’ll be the first to admit that Apple is pushing out new devices at a very fast pace and that’s going to hurt their overall business in the long run if they continue to stop supporting their older devices and expect their customers to buy new devices every 3 years. I am completely satisfied with this model and contrary to what some people have posted, the device is very relevant for certain task management. I have two different adapters for this MacBook Pro and one is very heavy and has the ability to add three 4K monitors as it’s powered by a separate power supply"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "Thought: The Apple MacBook Pro has a high rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars, with 43,642 reviews.
