For a rotating black\\nhole a shape and a position of a black hole shadow are not symmetric with\\nrespect to a rotation axis of a black hole shadow. So, in this case the minimum\\ninterval between a mass center of a black hole and a shadow axis is finite.

Since blockchain runs as an immutable\\ndistributed ledger, it has decentralized mechanisms with persistency,\\nanonymity, and auditability, where transactions are jointly performed through\\ncryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There\\nhave been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from\\ndifferent perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and\\nsmart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data\\nmanagement systems. To fill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive\\nsurvey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of\\nblockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed\\nAcyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms\\ninto three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and\\nblockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record\\ntransactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the\\ninternal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine specifies the\\nstorage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works\\nadvancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical\\nchallenges.

However, few of them could reveal the concerns of front-line\\ndevelopers and the situations of blockchain in practice. In this article, we\\ninvestigate how developers use and discuss blockchain with a case study of\\nStack Overflow posts. We find blockchain is a relatively new topic in Stack\\nOverflow but it is rising to popularity. We detect 13 types of questions that\\ndevelopers post in Stack Overflow and identify 45 blockchain relevant entities\\n(e.g., frameworks, libraries, or tools) for building blockchain applications.\\nThese findings may help blockchain project communities to know where to improve\\nand help novices to know where to start.\\n\",\n        \"link\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07080v1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"title\": \"From Portfolio Optimization to Quantum Blockchain and Security: A\\n  Systematic Review of Quantum Computing in Finance\",\n        \"summary\": \"  In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent work in the quantum\\nfinance realm from various perspectives.
