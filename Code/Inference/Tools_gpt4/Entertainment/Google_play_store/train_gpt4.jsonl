So Tyson brings the universe down to Earth succinctly and clearly, with sparkling wit, in tasty chapters consumable anytime and anywhere in your busy day. While you wait for your morning coffee to brew, for the bus, the train, or a plane to arrive, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry will reveal just what you need to be fluent and ready for the next cosmic headlines: from the Big Bang to black holes, from quarks to quantum mechanics, and from the search for planets to the search for life in the universe.\"}, {\"title\": \"Accessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military\", \"link\": \"https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson_Accessory_to_War_The_Unspoken?id=-WRSDwAAQBAJ\", \"product_id\": \"-WRSDwAAQBAJ\", \"serpapi_link\": \"https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_play_product&gl=us&hl=en&platform=phone&product_id=-WRSDwAAQBAJ&sort_by=1&store=books\", \"rating\": 4.5, \"author\": \"Neil deGrasse Tyson\", \"category\": \"Politics & current events\", \"original_price\": \"$18.95\", \"extracted_original_price\": 18.95, \"price\": \"$9.99\", \"extracted_price\": 9.99, \"thumbnail\": \"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/-WRSDwAAQBAJ?fife=w256-h256\", \"description\": \"“Extraordinary.… A feast of history, an expert tour through thousands of years of war and conquest.” —Jennifer Carson, New York Times Book Review In this far-reaching foray into the millennia-long relationship between science and military power, acclaimed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-author Avis Lang examine how the methods and tools of astrophysics have been enlisted in the service of war.

The second half of their text covers stellar, galactic, and extragalactic astronomy, followed by a brief discussion of cosmology. This is a reissue of the original 2010 edition, which has established itself as one of the market-leading astrophysics texts, well known for its clarity and simplicity.
