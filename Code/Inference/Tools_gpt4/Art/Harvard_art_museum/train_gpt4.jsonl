seven thousand years. From Neolithic ceramics to archaic jades and ritual bronzes, the arts of China’s ancient past demonstrate technical sophistication, brilliant craftsmanship, and the frequent implementation of large-scale production methods, especially in objects created for the elite.\\r\\nEven before the widespread use of metal implements, Neolithic cultures in China produced fine pottery and carved jades, the most elaborate of which were buried in the graves of important personages. A belief in the afterlife and in the ability of deceased forebears to exert influence over life in the present world led to the practice of ancestor worship, especially among those in power in Bronze Age China. To appease ancestral spirits, ritual offerings of food and wine were presented in highly decorated bronze vessels; these vessels were later interred in their owners’ tombs, along with numerous other grave goods designed for use in the afterlife. The demand for bronze vessels reached its peak during the Shang (c. 1600–c. 1050 BCE) and Zhou (c. 1050–256 BCE) dynasties. Jades used for either ritual or ornamental purposes were buried with the dead from the late Neolithic period (c. 5000–c. 2000 BCE) to the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). The creation of these intricate objects required the control of vast quantities of raw materials and skilled labor—something possible only for the ruling class. Bronzes and other tomb objects required for religious rites thus came to symbolize the power of the elite. \\r\\nDesigned as ritual objects, the works in this gallery are now appreciated both for their aesthetic qualities and for what they reveal about China’s illustrious past, as it evolved from a series of Neolithic settlements to clusters of powerful kingdoms, and eventually to a unified empire.\", \"objectcount\": 166, \"galleryid\": 1740, \"name\": \"Early Chinese Art\", \"theme\": \"Arts of Ancient China from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age\", \"id\": 1740, \"lastupdate\": \"2023-10-04T04:43:01-0400\", \"floor\": 1, \"url\": \"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/floor-plan/1/1740\"}, {\"gallerynumber\": \"3200\", \"labeltext\": \"White marble and nude bodies signify Classical art unlike any other material and form. Centuries of collecting and emulating Classical sculpture established the notion of its timeless perfection.

The greater critical distance actually benefits our understanding of Classical art, allowing us to recognize its time-bound nature and inviting us to appreciate it on its own terms.\\r\\nThe ancient marble sculptures in this colonnade have often been seen as examples of Greek art, but they are in fact of Roman origin and represent an early phase in a long history of reception. Many of the Greek sculptors of the fifth and fourth centuries BCE praised by ancient authors—Phidias, Polykleitos, Skopas, Praxiteles, Lysippus—worked in bronze and in gold and ivory, materials less enduring than stone. Most of their sculptures are lost. What remains are numerous Roman marble statues in Greek style. Traditionally, these have been classified as copies of famous Greek works, but the creativity of the Roman period sculptors should not be underestimated. As they carved statuary for an audience that admired Greek intellectual culture and art, they went beyond simple copying, creating variants and new sculptural types specifically for Roman tastes and settings, such as temples, theaters, bath buildings, houses, and villas.\\r\\nThis gallery also includes smaller works. Representations of the female body across the ages provide a counterpart to the Greek preoccupation with the male nude. Coins with elaborate designs represent Greek sculptural originals.

\"2520\", \"labeltext\": \"The Fogg Museum houses the world’s largest collection of clay models by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the most celebrated sculptor of the baroque period. The selection displayed here presents clay sketches (bozzetti) and a model (modello) he made for a range of public projects. These clay models were then dried or fired in a kiln: the term “terracotta” can be translated as “baked earth.”\\r\\nBernini began by sketching in clay, then developing his ideas through subsequent versions. These models were then transformed into large-scale sculptures in marble or bronze, often by his workshop. Imprinted on the surface of the clay are the movements of Bernini’s hands, a variety of tool marks, and even his fingerprints. Close examination of the bozzetti provides insight into the artistic process of this preeminent sculptor.\\r\\nBernini created the bozzetti of standing angels holding the instruments of the Passion while designing the marble angels on the Sant’Angelo bridge that crosses Rome’s Tiber River (1937.57, 1937.58, 1937.67, 1937.68, 1937.69). Enlivened by their pose and drapery, these angels exemplify Bernini’s masterful manipulation of light and shadow.\\r\\nThe group of bozzetti for the two gilded bronze angels that flank the altar of the Holy Sacrament in Saint Peter’s Basilica represents both Bernini’s earlier and final designs. In his initial conception of Half-Kneeling Angels (1937.65, 1937.66), the drapery creates the illusion that the angels are suspended between flight and rest. In his final design, the two Kneeling Angels (1937.63, 1937.64) are posed in an attitude of prayer.\\r\\nAlso for Saint Peter’s, the modello for the marble sculpture of Longinus is caught in the charged moment of his conversion to Christianity after piercing the side of Christ with his spear (1937.51). The gilding indicates its possible use as a presentation piece for its patron, Pope Urban VIII, or as a prized trophy in the hands of a later collector.\\r\\nBy contrast, the full-scale bozzetto for the head of Saint Jerome captures a more interior moment of religious meditation and penitence (1937.77). Though Bernini made many such full-size head studies, this is the only one to survive, and his numerous revisions in the clay are descriptive of his use of these models to design his works.\\r\\nThese clay models reveal the evolution of ideas as Bernini prepared his monumental sculptures; but they also offer an intimate view of the artist and his technique.\", \"objectcount\": 13, \"galleryid\": 2520, \"name\": \"European Art, 17th century\", \"theme\": null, \"id\": 2520, \"lastupdate\": \"2023-10-04T04:43:00-0400\", \"floor\": 2, \"url\": \"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/floor-plan/2/2520\"}, {\"gallerynumber\": \"2240\", \"labeltext\": \"The Arts in the 18th-Century Atlantic World\\r\\nBetween 1700 and 1800, thousands of trading ships crisscrossed the Atlantic Ocean. Carrying raw materials and finished products, free and enslaved people, and word of new discoveries and scientific advances, these ships circulated a range of ideas and images and linked cities and communities across Britain, Europe, and North and South America into a vast, interconnected culture. This gallery brings together paintings, works on paper, and pieces of decorative art to explore the intersection between the arts and this larger web of circulation and exchange.\\r\\nEighteenth-century artists mined the past for inspiration, and many of the works on display here make use of forms, subjects, and symbols derived from the ancient world. Disseminated through illustrations of archaeological discoveries in elaborate folios like Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s Antiquities of Rome, this neoclassical vocabulary constituted the lingua franca of the interconnected Atlantic. Classical references were as common in portraits from colonial Boston as they were in paintings acquired by collectors on the Grand Tour, like Vanvitelli’s view of the Colosseum.\\r\\nIn an age of expansive trade, works of art and domestic objects were regularly sent across the ocean. Charles Willson Peale painted his standing portrait of George Washington in Philadelphia, then promptly crated and shipped it off to Paris, where it remained for much of its history. Filled with Asian silks and Cuban mahogany, John Singleton Copley’s portraits of the Boylston family celebrate the new world of exotic commodities that overseas trade had opened up.\\r\\nArtist’s materials, tools, and knowledge of art-making techniques also moved around the Atlantic. Many of the works in this gallery are products of these new methods and materials. The case in the center of the room highlights two extraordinary examples: a wampum wrist ornament fabricated in New England with the help of steel drills imported from Europe and a ceramic punch bowl crafted in Britain and based on Asian prototypes.\", \"objectcount\": 19, \"galleryid\": 2240, \"name\": \"European and American Art, 17th–19th century\", \"theme\": \"The Arts in the Eighteenth–Century Atlantic World\", \"id\": 2240, \"lastupdate"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "Thought: \nAction: search_resource\nAction Input: {\"res_type\": \"gallery\", \"page\": \"2\"}"}]}

From the first century BCE to the fifth century CE, the inhabitants of the empire were connected by the material elements of Roman life—from the monumental (baths, amphitheaters, forums, and aqueducts) to the personal (ceramics, brooches, and household gods). Roman customs and visual culture drew not only on Greek traditions but also on those of the Etruscans, Iberians, Celts, Egyptians, and others who were united under Roman rule. In religion, native Italian traditions, such as the offering of anatomical votives, were preserved alongside newly encountered beliefs. Evolving practices sometimes combined the characteristics and functions of deities, such as the Egyptian Isis with the Roman Venus, who was essentially the Greek Aphrodite. Roman influence in laws, individual representation, coins, and decorative motifs continued into the Byzantine and medieval periods.\\r\\nEmbellished with the attributes of deities, heroes, and conquerors, the portraits of Roman emperors and their families were prominent on coins. Their statues were set up in forums throughout the empire and venerated in shrines dedicated to the imperial cult, which helped to reinforce the loyalty of the common people, many of whom would never personally see their ruler. Wealthy private citizens also commissioned statues of themselves, in some cases following imperial models, but funerary sculpture—including urns, sarcophagi, and especially inscriptions—was the primary medium for individual commemoration. A common scene depicted in Roman funerary reliefs, wall paintings, mosaics, and literature was the banquet, where the diners would recline to eat while they were entertained by music, dancing, or even physical contests. The luxury tableware left behind is a testament to the decadence of the Roman banquet, which has inspired artistic representations from the Renaissance to this day. \", \"objectcount\": 93, \"galleryid\": 3700, \"name\": \""}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "Thought: \nAction: search_resource\nAction Input: {\"res_type\": \"gallery\", \"page\": \"3\"}"}]}

Classical references were as common in portraits from colonial Boston as they were in paintings acquired by collectors on the Grand Tour, like Vanvitelli’s view of the Colosseum.\\r\\nIn an age of expansive trade, works of art and domestic objects were regularly sent across the ocean. Charles Willson Peale painted his standing portrait of George Washington in Philadelphia, then promptly crated and shipped it off to Paris, where it remained for much of its history. Filled with Asian silks and Cuban mahogany, John Singleton Copley’s portraits of the Boylston family celebrate the new world of exotic commodities that overseas trade had opened up.\\r\\nArtist’s materials, tools, and knowledge of art-making techniques also moved around the Atlantic. Many of the works in this gallery are products of these new methods and materials. The case in the center of the room highlights two extraordinary examples: a wampum wrist ornament fabricated in New England with the help of steel drills imported from Europe and a ceramic punch bowl crafted in Britain and based on Asian prototypes.\", \"objectcount\": 19, \"galleryid\": 2240, \"name\": \"European and American Art, 17th–19th century\", \"theme\": \"The Arts in the Eighteenth–Century Atlantic World\", \"id\": 2240, \"lastupdate"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "Thought: \nAction: search_resource\nAction Input: {\"res_type\": \"gallery\", \"page\": \"2\"}"}, {"from": "function", "value": "{\"info\": {\"totalrecordsperquery\": 10, \"totalrecords\": 64, \"pages\": 7, \"page\": 2, \"next\": \"https://api.harvardartmuseums.org/gallery?apikey=d67d5943-c80f-4485-b58b-e93e998f0443&size=10&page=3&sort=random&sortorder=asc\", \"prev\": \"https://api.harvardartmuseums.org/gallery?apikey=d67d5943-c80f-4485-b58b-e93e998f0443&size=10&page=1&sort=random&sortorder=asc\", \"responsetime\": \"6 ms\"}, \"records\": [{\"gallerynumber\": \"2590\", \"labeltext\": \"The Early Modern Era in South Asia\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the medieval era, Muslims had established numerous principalities across the Indian subcontinent—notably in the Punjab, Bengal, and the Indo-Gangetic plain, and in the southern plateau region known as the Deccan.

Secessions—pr gressive art associations that eschewed such official support—promoted painting, sculpture, graphic arts, and architecture, often within their own exhibition spaces. Looking beyond their own borders in support of an international as opposed to a regional or national agenda, they introduced their audiences to foreign avant-garde art such as French impressionism and Nordic modernism.\\r\\nThe first such separatist movement in central Europe was founded in Munich in 1892. Established five years later, the Vienna Secession advanced a more pronounced aesthetic position, promoting the unification of art and design.The Berlin Secession’s official formation in 1898 sought to challenge the conservative art policies of Emperor Wilhelm II; the city eventually usurped Munich’s position as Germany’s modern art center. The period also saw the rise of expressionism, exemplified in the foundation of the group Brücke (Bridge) in Dresden in 1905; it fiercely challenged academic conventions of art making, while valorizing the notion of a subjective inner vision. The increasing acceptance of the “new art” saw the waning influence of the secessions in Germany.

the reign of French king Louis XV (1715–1774), and neoclassicism, which emerged mid-century. The term rococo is a combination of the French word rocaille—a style of ornament with an elaborate, often asymmetrical conflation of natural elements, especially plants, stones, and shells—and the Italian word barocco, which refers to the baroque style, characterized by exuberant ornamentation and dramatic action. Artists of this era favored a palette of light hues; they frequently alluded to contemporary dance and theater; and particularly in the realm of decorative arts, they borrowed elements from Chinese art that was being exported to Europe. These traits led to the characterization of rococo art as lighthearted and fantastical, despite its continued consideration of sober, moral subjects—such as the Virgin’s Purification in Corrado Giaquinto’s painting at the center of this gallery—and its studied attentiveness to tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNeoclassicism, a style based on the art of ancient Greece and Rome, developed in tandem with archaeological excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii toward the middle of the century. The availability of extensive new evidence of the arts of antiquity—coupled later in the century with the scholarly writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768), who distinguished styles in the art of different ancient civilizations—triggered a demand for greater accuracy in the visual representation of ancient subjects. Artists responded to this necessity by importing into their compositions classical forms and objects that they had seen in ancient collections or knew through prints. Young collectors from northern European countries sought to expand their knowledge of antiquity by traveling through Italy on an extensive trip known as the Grand Tour. While visiting ancient sites and museums, they purchased antiquities and contemporary art for their burgeoning private collections.\", \"objectcount\": 42, \"galleryid\": 2220, \"name\": \"European and American Art, 17th–19th century\", \"theme\": \"Rococo and Neoclassicism in the Eighteenth Century\", \"id\": 2220, \"lastupdate\": \"2023-10-04T04:43:01-0400\", \"floor\": 2, \"url\": \"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/floor-plan/2/2220\"}, {\"gallerynumber\": \"2340\", \"labeltext\": \"For centuries, silver was among the most revered and highly valued materials in Britain.

The scale of the paintings they commissioned often required the services of a large workshop, such as that operated by Peter Paul Rubens. His oil sketches, which we admire today for their inventive compositions and bravura technique, formed the basis for vast pictorial programs executed by his assistants. Rubens was the most renowned European painter of his generation. During his lifetime, Antwerp, the commercial and cultural capital of northern Europe in the previous century, remained a vibrant artistic center, even as its economy stagnated under the conservative Spanish regime and the Dutch dominated maritime commerce.\\r\\nInnovative finance, naval power, and agriculture and manufacturing sustained the Dutch Republic’s global trading empire. Economic growth generated unprecedented wealth, providing many private citizens with sufficient disposable income to purchase works of art. Dutch painters mostly produced modestly scaled pictures to hang in patrician and middle-class homes. Competition fostered specialization and the development of original pictorial imagery and techniques. With some exceptions, most notably Rembrandt van Rijn, Dutch painters depicted secular subjects grounded in the visible, material world, such as landscape, still life, and narrative scenes with figures in modern dress. Their works were valued then, as now, for their close observation of nature, compelling depictions of daily life at different levels of society, and skillful rendering of textures, light, space, and atmospheric effects.\", \"objectcount\": 21, \"galleryid\": 2300, \"name\": \"European Art, 17th–19th century\", \"theme\": \"Seventeenth–Century Dutch and Flemish Art\", \"id\": 2300, \"lastupdate\": \"2023-10-04T04:43:01-0400\", \"floor\": 2, \"url\": \"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/floor-plan/2/2300\"}, {\"gallerynumber\": \"2710\", \"labeltext\": null, \"objectcount\": 20, \"galleryid\": 2710, \"name\": \"North Arcade\", \"theme\": null, \"id\": 2710, \"lastupdate\": \"2023-10-04T04:43:01-0400\", \"floor\": 2, \"url\": \"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/floor-plan/2/2710\"}, {\"gallerynumber\": \"2500\", \"labeltext\": \"For centuries, artists were tasked with painting images (icons) of Christ and the Virgin Mary. Viewers believed that these likenesses had been created miraculously, and artists were able to give their work a sense of authenticity by adhering closely to images that were reputedly painted by Saint Luke, or by some other holy means. Over the centuries, Byzantine icons stayed true to these early images. Although there was considerable exchange between Europe and the East, the sack of Constantinople by Western European and Venetian crusaders in 1204 brought a wave of artwork from the Byzantine capital to Europe. Early Italian painters initially remained faithful to Byzantine models, but they soon broke away from the tradition, introducing personal and regional styles to their work. \\r\\nDuring the Renaissance, artistic practice became more codified through treatises as well as through critical awareness of differences between artists and regional styles. Around the middle of the sixteenth century, Giorgio Vasari, the Italian artist and art historian, wrote a magisterial history of the lives of Italian artists that assessed Italian painting from the previous three centuries.\\r\\nOne of the most important artistic categories was the altarpiece. The works in this gallery testify to the wealth of materials and techniques employed by carpenters, painters, and sculptors in making these sacred objects. In early panel paintings and polychromed wood sculpture, gold leaf and punched detail were employed to decorate the robes of holy figures. The rich and dense quality of prized blue pigment, which was derived from lapis lazuli sourced in Afghanistan, was often used to depict the Virgin’s cloak. Costly gold was tooled and polished to create luminous, unworldly backgrounds; over time, these gradually gave way to ultramarine skies.\\r\\nThe movement of material goods from East to West anticipated the traffic in works of art between the Old and New World. Itinerant objects like the ivory Crucified Christ, a Netherlandish-type crucifix possibly made in the Philippines by Chinese craftsmen for Catholic patrons in New Spain, remind us that the Renaissance’s flowering of the arts was fueled in part by unprecedented global exploration and growing colonial ambitions.\", \"objectcount\": 37, \"galleryid\": 2500, \"name\": \"European Art, 13th–16th century\", \"theme\": \"Art and Image in Europe\", \"id\": 2500, \"lastupdate\": \"2023-10-04T04:43:01-0400\", \"floor\": 2, \"url\": \"https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/visit/floor-plan/2/2500\"}, {\"gallerynumber\": \"2410\", \"labeltext\": null, \"objectcount\": 15, \"galleryid\": 2410, \"name\": \"South Arcade\", \"theme\": null, \"id\": 2"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "Thought: \nAction: finish\nAction Input: {\"answer\": \"Here are the names of the galleries in the Harvard Art Museum: \\n\\n1.

The Madi had two principal beliefs: that art could be created through diverse means and in unconventional media, such as neon, metal, cardboard, or water; and that it should engage viewers on multiple levels, inviting them to touch and even to manipulate it, thereby sparking intellectual curiosity. This object demonstrates one of Arden Quin’s central concerns: the intersection between word and image. The Boites are among a series of simple forms bearing text that he created.

It is a sculpture made of painted cardboard and wood, consisting of 7 pieces. The dimensions of each piece are 7.6 x 7.6 x 7.6 cm. The artwork is part of the collection of the Department of Modern & Contemporary Art at the Harvard Art Museums. It was transferred from the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, Harvard University in 2012. The artwork reflects the experimental, interdisciplinary approach of the Madi, a group of artists that formed in Buenos Aires in the 1940s. The small boxes can be arranged by the viewer to create different sentences, demonstrating one of Arden Quin\\u2019s central concerns: the intersection between word and image.

Hobbs shares the labor and intimacy of her private life in these prints, centering the negotiations she brokers daily to balance her manifold responsibilities—as a wife, mother, educator, and artist. The series is also a powerful statement about her influences and self-fashioning as an artist: references to paintings, sculptures, and prints by prominent artists such as Elizabeth Catlett, Alma Thomas, Valerie Maynard, and Kerry James Marshall appear throughout. <a href=\\\"https://hvrd.art/o/375871\\\"><em>Carving Out Time</em></a> (2020–21) is the largest expression within Hobbs’s ongoing <em>Salt of the Earth</em> project, which she characterizes as “the personification of Black women as salt in relation to their role as preservers of family, culture and community.” A contemplation of nuanced concepts of time and labor, the work offers an affecting visual statement that is at once deeply personal and universal. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>LaToya M. Hobbs: It’s Time</em> is the inaugural presentation of the full suite of prints and provides a unique opportunity to view the drawings that the artist made in preparation for the project, which she generously lent to the exhibition for their first public display. </p>\\n\\n<p>Hobbs received a B.A. in painting from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and an M.F.A. in printmaking from Purdue University. She is a co-founder of <a href=\\\"https://www.blackwomenofprint.com/\\\">Black Women of Print</a> and recently completed residencies at the Penland School of Craft and the Women’s Studio Workshop. Hobbs won the Janet and Walter Sondheim Artscape Prize in 2020 and was a finalist for the Queen Sonja Print Award in 2022.

Hobbs</a>. Unfolding over five scenes, the work depicts one day in Hobbs’s life with her husband, visual artist Ariston Jacks, and their two children. Hobbs shares the labor and intimacy of her private life in these prints, centering the negotiations she brokers daily to balance her manifold responsibilities—as a wife, mother, educator, and artist. The series is also a powerful statement about her influences and self-fashioning as an artist: references to paintings, sculptures, and prints by prominent artists such as Elizabeth Catlett, Alma Thomas, Valerie Maynard, and Kerry James Marshall appear throughout. <a href=\\\"https://hvrd.art/o/375871\\\"><em>Carving Out Time</em></a> (2020–21) is the largest expression within Hobbs’s ongoing <em>Salt of the Earth</em> project, which she characterizes as “the personification of Black women as salt in relation to their role as preservers of family, culture and community.” A contemplation of nuanced concepts of time and labor, the work offers an affecting visual statement that is at once deeply personal and universal. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>LaToya M. Hobbs: It’s Time</em> is the inaugural presentation of the full suite of prints and provides a unique opportunity to view the drawings that the artist made in preparation for the project, which she generously lent to the exhibition for their first public display. </p>\\n\\n<p>Hobbs received a B.A. in painting from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and an M.F.A. in printmaking from Purdue University. She is a co-founder of <a href=\\\"https://www.blackwomenofprint.com/\\\">Black Women of Print</a> and recently completed residencies at the Penland School of Craft and the Women’s Studio Workshop. Hobbs won the Janet and Walter Sondheim Artscape Prize in 2020 and was a finalist for the Queen Sonja Print Award in 2022. She teaches at the Maryland Institute College of Art. </p>\\n\\n<p>Organized by <a href=\\\"https://harvardartmuseums.org/about/staff/30\\\">Elizabeth M. Rudy</a>, Carl A.

Hobbs: It’s Time presents the series Carving Out Time, a life-size suite of woodcuts by Arkansas-born and Baltimore-based artist LaToya M. Hobbs. Unfolding over five scenes, the work depicts one day in Hobbs’s life with her husband, visual artist Ariston Jacks, and their two children. Hobbs shares the labor and intimacy of her private life in these prints, centering the negotiations she brokers daily to balance her manifold responsibilities—as a wife, mother, educator, and artist. The series is also a powerful statement about her influences and self-fashioning as an artist: references to paintings, sculptures, and prints by prominent artists such as Elizabeth Catlett, Alma Thomas, Valerie Mayn"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "Thought: Based on the search results, there are four upcoming exhibitions featuring works from the 19th century.

Decorative arts are typically displayed in museum galleries dedicated to the same culture and period, often in isolation from other media. In <em>Disrupt the View</em>, however, Shechet draws on her past collaborations with porcelain manufactory workers to speak to a larger history, recontextualizing these remarkable objects as both handmade and industrially manufactured, painterly and sculptural. </p>\\n\\n<p>Invented by Chinese potters in the Tang Dynasty (618–903 CE), porcelain later became one of the first global luxury products. It was at first available in Europe only to the wealthiest patrons, but by the late 17th century, millions of porcelain objects were being imported each year by the Dutch East India Company. European porcelain production was driven by courtly ambition in competition with Asian markets, and its artisans, who created these objects for lavish celebrations, were largely unknown. The story of porcelain, then, is one of labor, class, and global trade. In 1710, the German porcelain manufactory Meissen was founded, and significant examples of its 18th-century tableware and figurines are now in the Busch-Reisinger Museum collection. Many of these objects have rarely, if ever, been shown. </p>\\n\\n<p>Among other objects, Shechet has created an unparalleled installation that includes two constellations of tableware that emphasize the unique material qualities of plates as sculptural design. Visible from the exterior of the museums, these arrangements, like the painted decoration on the individual plates, invite the outside in and—literally and metaphorically—disrupt the view. </p>\\n\\n<p>Organized by <a href=\\\"https://harvardartmuseums.org/about/staff/33\\\"><strong>Lynette Roth</strong></a>, Daimler Curator of the Busch-Reisinger Museum; <a href=\\\"https://harvardartmuseums.org/about/staff/35\\\"><strong>Jessica Ficken</strong></a>, Cunningham Curatorial Assistant for the Collection in the Division of Modern and Contemporary Art; and <strong>Gabriella Szalay</strong>, former Renke B. and Pamela M.

On March 11, 2015, the films were replaced with three large-scale paintings on loan to the museums. Just as she tailored the body extensions from her performances in the early 1970s — seen in the gallery in six black-and-white photographs from the portfolio <em>Performance Edition</em> (printed 2000) — to fit her own measurements and those of her friends and collaborators, the dimensions of the paper support of the new works on view, called Bodylandscapes, correspond to the size, and thereby the limits and possibilities, of her own body. </p>\\n\\n<p>Also on display is a new work painted mechanically during the activation of the specially commissioned kinetic sculpture by Rebecca Horn, <em><a href=\\\"http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/350526\\\">Flying Books under Black Rain Painting</a></em> (2014), which is installed inside the museums’ new Prescott Street entrance. Titled <em>Out of the Black Rain</em>, this three-part work corresponds to the books featured as part of the commissioned sculpture: Fernando Pessoa’s <em>The Book of Disquiet</em>, Franz Kafka’s <em>Amerika</em>, and James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, all chosen by the artist for the way that they resonate in a university context. Like <em>Out of the Black Rain</em>, five multiples, or editioned artworks, dating from the 1970s through the 1990s are also installed in cases designed by the artist.</p>\\n\\n<p>Together with the exhibition, the museums will offer a program of Rebecca Horn’s full-length feature films. <em>The Gigolo (Der Eintänzer)</em> (1978), <em>Buster’s Bedroom</em> (1990), <em>Moon Mirror Journey</em> (2011), and her earliest films from 1970–72 (<em>Performances 1</em>) will be shown in Menschel Hall on Sunday afternoons throughout the duration of the exhibition. The film series is free. </p>\\n\\n<p>The exhibition has been curated by Lynette Roth, the Daimler-Benz Curator of the Busch-Reisinger Museum, and was funded by the Charles L. Kuhn Endowment Fund.

Hobbs</a>. Unfolding over five scenes, the work depicts one day in Hobbs’s life with her husband, visual artist Ariston Jacks, and their two children. Hobbs shares the labor and intimacy of her private life in these prints, centering the negotiations she brokers daily to balance her manifold responsibilities—as a wife, mother, educator, and artist. The series is also a powerful statement about her influences and self-fashioning as an artist: references to paintings, sculptures, and prints by prominent artists such as Elizabeth Catlett, Alma Thomas, Valerie Maynard, and Kerry James Marshall appear throughout. <a href=\\\"https://hvrd.art/o/375871\\\"><em>Carving Out Time</em></a> (2020–21) is the largest expression within Hobbs’s ongoing <em>Salt of the Earth</em> project, which she characterizes as “the personification of Black women as salt in relation to their role as preservers of family, culture and community.” A contemplation of nuanced concepts of time and labor, the work offers an affecting visual statement that is at once deeply personal and universal. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>LaToya M. Hobbs: It’s Time</em> is the inaugural presentation of the full suite of prints and provides a unique opportunity to view the drawings that the artist made in preparation for the project, which she generously lent to the exhibition for their first public display. </p>\\n\\n<p>Hobbs received a B.A. in painting from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and an M.F.A. in printmaking from Purdue University. She is a co-founder of <a href=\\\"https://www.blackwomenofprint.com/\\\">Black Women of Print</a> and recently completed residencies at the Penland School of Craft and the Women’s Studio Workshop. Hobbs won the Janet and Walter Sondheim Artscape Prize in 2020 and was a finalist for the Queen Sonja Print Award in 2022. She teaches at the Maryland Institute College of Art. </p>\\n\\n<p>Organized by <a href=\\\"https://harvardartmuseums.org/about/staff/30\\\">Elizabeth M. Rudy</a>, Carl A.

Hobbs shares the labor and intimacy of her private life in these prints, centering the negotiations she brokers daily to balance her manifold responsibilities—as a wife, mother, educator, and artist. The series is also a powerful statement about her influences and self-fashioning as an artist: references to paintings, sculptures, and prints by prominent artists such as Elizabeth Catlett, Alma Thomas, Valerie Maynard, and Kerry James Marshall appear throughout. <a href=\\\"https://hvrd.art/o/375871\\\"><em>Carving Out Time</em></a> (2020–21) is the largest expression within Hobbs’s ongoing <em>Salt of the Earth</em> project, which she characterizes as “the personification of Black women as salt in relation to their role as preservers of family, culture and community.” A contemplation of nuanced concepts of time and labor, the work offers an affecting visual statement that is at once deeply personal and universal. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>LaToya M. Hobbs: It’s Time</em> is the inaugural presentation of the full suite of prints and provides a unique opportunity to view the drawings that the artist made in preparation for the project, which she generously lent to the exhibition for their first public display. </p>\\n\\n<p>Hobbs received a B.A. in painting from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and an M.F.A. in printmaking from Purdue University. She is a co-founder of <a href=\\\"https://www.blackwomenofprint.com/\\\">Black Women of Print</a> and recently completed residencies at the Penland School of Craft and the Women’s Studio Workshop. Hobbs won the Janet and Walter Sondheim Artscape Prize in 2020 and was a finalist for the Queen Sonja Print Award in 2022. She teaches at the Maryland Institute College of Art. </p>\\n\\n<p>Organized by <a href=\\\"https://harvardartmuseums.org/about/staff/30\\\">Elizabeth M. Rudy</a>, Carl A.
